# fensap2slurm
Converts fensap '.solvercmd' into a series of slurm template.

Currently the FENSAPICE GUI allows two ways of running on an HPC.

* Launch directly though GUI with custom MPI parameters.
    + Each MPI stage is given the same set of custom parameters, even though time and resource usage varies dramatically.
    + Simplest to launch but less reproducible and more time consuming.
    + Closing the session means the next stage of the job will not start.

* Launch using 'scheduler' setting.
    + Entire workflow contained within one job, very high time requirements.
    + Same resources given to each stage, but at least they only have to queue once.

This script converts the .solvercmd generated by fensap into a series of SLURM templates. Each stage is now a discrete job with it's own resource requirements. Each job submits the next step without the need for a background process.
